```

### Pages

| | Page | What it does |
|---|------|-------------|

## 💻 CLI

```bash

```

```bash
vault add "ephemeral" --book "Sapiens" --chapter "The Cognitive Revolution" \
  --meaning "lasting for a very short time" \
  --synonyms "transient, fleeting" \
  --context "The ephemeral nature of early settlements left few traces."

vault review                    # Review all due words
vault review --book "Sapiens"   # Scope to a book
vault stats                     # XP, level, streak
vault books                     # List books
vault sync                      # Markdown <-> SQLite sync
vault export                    # JSON export
vault wotd                      # Word of the Day
```

## 🔧 How It Works

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Frontend (Next.js 14)                   │
│  Pages, gamification UI, PWA             │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Backend (FastAPI)                       │
│  Auth, routing, per-user DB isolation    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CLI / Service Layer (Python)            │
│  All business logic lives here           │
│  SQLite + Markdown dual storage          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The backend imports the CLI package directly - no duplicated logic. Fixes to the service layer benefit both CLI and web.

> **Dual storage:** All writes go through SQLite first (FTS5 search, gamification state). After every write, the Markdown file is regenerated. `vault sync` handles the reverse direction.

### ⚔️ Gamification

| XP | Level |
|:---|:------|
| 0 | 🌱 Novice |
| 100 | 📖 Page Turner |
| 500 | 🐛 Bookworm |
| 1,500 | 🔨 Word Smith |
| 5,000 | 👑 Lexicon Lord |
| 15,000 | 🏰 Vocabulary Vault Master |

> +10 XP per word added · +5 XP per correct review · Streaks track daily activity

### 🧠 Review System

Mastery levels 0-5 with increasing intervals: **1, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days**. Correct answers increase mastery. Wrong answers reset to level 1.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|:------|:-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, Framer Motion |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, JWT auth (httpOnly cookies), per-user SQLite vaults |
| **CLI** | Python, Click, Rich |
| **Database** | SQLite (WAL mode, FTS5), Markdown files |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions |
| **Deploy** | Render.com, Docker |

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v              # CLI tests (47)
cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -v # Backend tests (28)
```

## 🗺 What's Next

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full feature plan, including:
